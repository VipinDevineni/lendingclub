            <p>
                Erica is a single mom to her 2 wonderful daughters 6 and 8 years old. In order to make ends meet, she has to work 2 jobs - as a full-time school teacher and as a part time waitress over weekends. Spending time with her daughters is a luxury that she can
                barely afford. In 2015 Christmas, like every other parent, she wanted to surprise her babies with gifts. Unfortunately, she didn't have the money. Borrowing from friends or family was not an option. Her only option was Payday Loans. She
                took out a loan for $275 to buy gifts for her daughters. Being cash strapped, she couldn't pay back the loan in due time and ended up renewing it 5 times, getting slapped on with late charges and additional interests every single time.
                After 4 long months, she was able to pay back the loan - a total amount of $575 for a loan of only $275. Is that fair we ask?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the state of affairs in our society. Honest hard working people with limited resources are being exploited by predatory lending practices. Erica and thousands of others have fallen prey to these Payday loan businesses, designed to profit off of
                other peoples unfortunate circumstances. We want to provide a cheaper, sustainable and better alternative to short term borrowing needs.

                    Can I cancel the service after enrolling?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    You can cancel anytime you want, provided you don't owe us any money. There is no penalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But since plans are based on yearly contract if you want to re-enroll, you'll need to pay back the monthly membership fees for remainder of your last contract period.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The plans are based on yearly contract but if you don't like the service you can cancel anytime. You need to have paid off any outstanding loan in order to cancel the plan. Once you cancel, you'll loose all benefits. In order to join back, you'll need
                    to pay back any missed monthly membership fee for remainder of the contract period.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    It's simple - we need proof of employment/paychecks. Users will apply for membership on our site. Once we verify their information, we will provide the application approval decison by the end of the day. In some cases, users may be required to provide
                    additional information such as bank statements, proof of identification etc.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <blockquote>
                    When I can get the money?
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Members can make a request for money. Based on the plan they subscribe to, we will deposit the money into your bank account the next day.
